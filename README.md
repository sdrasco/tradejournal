Tradejournal is a lightweight web-based journal designed to help traders reflect on their decisions and learn from past performance. The project showcases a clean interface that highlights individual trades, key metrics, and personal notes. By reviewing trends and outcomes at a glance, users can quickly spot patterns that may improve their strategy.

The app is built as a static site, so you can host it on any simple web server or deploy it through GitHub Pages. Customize the included `data.json` file with your own trade history to instantly tailor the experience to your needs. The included screenshot below illustrates the layout and visual style of the dashboard.
